	We have trained the data by selecting random states stored in file under resource
	folder by playing games against opponenet by choosing random moves.

	Performance of system is seen by by playing against computer that makes random move 
	using the values of weight learnt by running ExprienceT.
	
	weight values are stored in weightValuesT file under resource folder.

2. gameNT 
	used for game in no teacher mode
	run LearnerNT, ExperienceNT and GameNT classes inorder.
	LearnerNT initialises weight values initially
	ExpereinceNT trains the machine to play.
	GameNT is the file which we use to see the machine performance.
	
	We have trained the data by selecting random states stored in file under resource
	folder by playing games against opponet by choosing random moves. I have simulated 	
	a Tic Tac Toe game to do the same. Opponent also makes random moves.

	Performance of system is seen by by playing against  computer that makes random move 
	using the values of weight learnt by running ExprienceNT.

	weight values are stored in weightValuesNT file under resource folder.

		qwerty is the game number.
